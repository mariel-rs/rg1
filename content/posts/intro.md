Hi there. My name is Alex. I am an engineer who had the opportunity to have 
been appointed to spend a couple of years in the United Kingdom. I spent most of 
my time travelling around Europe, and sometimes beyondâ€¦
<!--more-->

Many people asked me to keep track of all these trips and so I have finally 
decided to publish them. I have changed a few names names and sometimes 
locations, but overall the recollection is as close to reality as it was 
(or at least, to my own knowledge!) After making the decision of publishing, 
I didnâ€™t know where I should post this. Wattpad was an option; however, it 
seems Wattpad is mostly for fanfiction and in my case, itâ€™s not exactly that. 
In the end, I decided to do it on my own site instead.

My writing style is as amateur as it can be for a person who has never been 
trained nor never taken proper classes. I may take some classes at some time. 
The ambiance I want to recreate is if we were having a nice cup of something 
(tea, coffee, hot water, squash drinkâ€¦) while enjoying an late and lazy 
afternoon sitting on comfortable couches. I will be updating this site on a 
frequent basis, so we continue having these lazy afternoons over the days.

Perhaps you may want to share your impressions or even your own adventures after 
reading mines ðŸ˜‰ In the meantime, please have a seat and enjoy.
